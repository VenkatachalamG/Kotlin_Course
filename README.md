# Kotlin Basics  


<head><h2>Hi everyone! 😁</h2></head>

I have created this repository to document all the programs I am practising while learning the fundamentals of Kotlin.  

### Topics Covered:
- Variables  
- Functions  
- Inheritance  
- Practice Problems  
- And more...  

I am learning Kotlin fundamentals as part of the **Kotlin for Android App Development** course on [Google Developers](https://developer.android.com/).  

I will continue adding more content to this repository in the coming days.  

Thank you for viewing this repo! Hope you find it helpful 😊
